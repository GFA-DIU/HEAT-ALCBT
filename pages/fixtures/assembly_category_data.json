Then they are cast on a continuously rotating cylinder and rolled through pressure rolls to a specified thickness. They are often used as vertical cladding or on pitched roofs. Corrugated zinc sheets are widely used for roofs as they are easy to install due to being prefabricated; also, they are cheap and very light. The corrugations increase the bending strength of the sheet in the direction perpendicular to the corrugations, but not parallel to them."

            "description": "Beside steel, aluminum is the most used metal in construction. It is one of the lightest and easiest metals to manipulate, bend, shape, cast, fasten and weld, and is also very ductile, often extruded into shapes for architectural purposes. It can easily be drilled, tapped, sawed, planed and filed with hand tools, making it a yielding material for tradesmen to use. Aluminum is commonly used as wall cladding or curtain-walls, as its resistance to corrosion is higher than steel, and lighter than other metals. However, the disadvantages are the higher cost and embodied energy, greater thermal expansion, and lower fire resistance as compared to steel. Most exterior applications using aluminum alloys are anodized surfaces, which increases the metal durability, traps dyes and adheres to other finishes. Plastic coatings, which are applied electrostatically as a powder and then heat cured, are also used for cladding wall panels. This coating gives a durable protection layer, with a more uniform appearance. The finished appearance can range from clear to a wide variety of colors and textures, depending on the coating applied. In addition, the panels can be installed with insulation for better thermal performance."

Expanded polystyrene is available in board form or as beads. Boards are produced by placing the beads in molds and heating them to fuse the beads together. Typical applications of EPS boards are for insulation of walls, roofs and floors. Polystyrene beads are frequently used as cavity fill in masonry walls. Extruded Polystyrene (XPS) is made by mixing polystyrene with a blowing agent under pressure and forcing it through a die. As it emerges from the die it expands into foam; it can then be shaped and trimmed. XPS is slightly stronger than EPS, and although it is used in many of the same applications as EPS, it is particularly suitable for use below ground or where extra loading and/or impacts might be anticipated."

There are two types of polystyrene insulation: Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) insulation is made from small beads of polystyrene that when heated cause them to expand; they are then mixed with a blowing agent (pentane). Expanded polystyrene is available in board form or as beads. Boards are produced by placing the beads in molds and heating them to fuse the beads together. Typical applications of EPS boards are for insulation of walls, roofs and floors. Polystyrene beads are frequently used as cavity fill in masonry walls. Extruded Polystyrene (XPS) is made by mixing polystyrene with a blowing agent under pressure and forcing it through a die. As it emerges from the die it expands into foam; it can then be shaped and trimmed. XPS is slightly stronger than EPS, and although it is used in many of the same applications as EPS, it is particularly suitable for use below ground or where extra loading and/or impacts might be anticipated."
